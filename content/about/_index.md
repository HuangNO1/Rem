### I am a unerversity student studying at Central South University (CSU) in China. I love programming programs, and I hope that I can find myself by programming. I also like to watch Japanese animation. My favorite music is the theme song of &lt;&lt;PSYCHO-PASS&gt;&gt;,  <em>名前のない怪物</em>. My hometown is in Taipei, Taiwan.
